				VMs vs Docker Containers

VM acts as physical computer as it uses physical resources of the underlying hardware of the computer it is running on.
VM has their own OS , also vm has full copyy of OS , application and liberaries etc
Since it uses all the resources and have its own applications, it can take up Gbs of space
VM is standalone os itself, it uses have high resource usage
There is alot to be done when running VMs since it requires set of softwares and dependencies to be installed to make the apps work
It may work on one machine and not on another due to compatibility issues on different OS

Container is abstraction layer of apps and liberaries
Containers they usualy take less space and it is isolated
Container share the kernel of the os which means multiple containers share same kernel of os and it then talk to hardware
Apps, liberaries and their dependenciew can be packaged into one conatiner
There are many containers Docker is one of them
Docker only needs to be installed and it is ready to use
It contains much less space and works same on diferent machines since it is kind of like a package
Docker container can scale very easily
